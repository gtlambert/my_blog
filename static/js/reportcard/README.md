reportcard
==========

This is a Report Card widget for tracking your online coding school progress. 

I started this project after posting about a pretty simple widget I had been working on back when Treehouse only had a facebook group as a forum, to see if anyone else had thought about embedding their "Report Card" on their personal site. Since there seemed to be some stellar interest, I have been working on this current version of the Report Card Widget as a side project for a number of months now. It has finally come together pretty well, and I am excited to announce version 1.0 of the Coding Report Card!
